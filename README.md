# Emprirical and model-based adaptive sampling

This repository contains code to support Box 1 in the paper "Adaptive sampling in ecology: current practice and future opportunities". The paper discusses the key principles of adaptive sampling, the various decisions and considerations required at each step and how it may be useful in ecological monitoring. The code here, provides a walkthrough of adaptive sampling using a simulated species, the hipporhinostricow. We outline the process of:

1. Using initial data to generate a criterion layer - a surface detailing sampling priorities
2. Selecting sampling locations from this layer
3. Deciding on the sampling activity - rounds vs batch size

## Code outline

All of the code is written in R v. and found in the `scripts/` folder. This contains three folders:

```bash

|- functions

## The hipporhinostricow  
by Spike Milligan


Such a beast is the Hipporhinostricow  
How it got so mixed up we'll never know how  
It sleeps all day and whistles all night  
And it wears yellow socks which are far too tight.  


If you laugh at the Hipporhinostricow  
You're bound to get into an awful row  
The creature is protected you see  
From Silly people like you and me.
