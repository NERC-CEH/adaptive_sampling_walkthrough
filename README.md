# Emprirical and model-based adaptive sampling

This repository contains code to support Box 1 in the paper "Adaptive sampling in ecology: current practice and future opportunities". The paper discusses the key principles of adaptive sampling, the various decisions and considerations required at each step and how it may be useful in ecological monitoring. The code here, provides a walkthrough of adaptive sampling using a simulated species, the hipporhinostricow. We outline the process of:

1. Using initial data to generate a criterion layer - a surface detailing sampling priorities
2. Selecting sampling locations from this layer
3. Deciding on the sampling activity - rounds vs batch size
